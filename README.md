# Optimized-Shortest-Path-Finding-Using-GNN-Algorithm
Optimized Shortest Path-Finding Graph algorithm using Graph Neural Networks - Advanced Algorithms Literature Survey involving In depth analysis of graph algorithm to find shortest path between points using an algorithm to show how Graph Network with attention read and write can perform shortest path calculations with minimal training and 100% accuracy

Given a question about the shortest path between two points
A and B ( example city Bengaluru and Delhi) and a graph (as
a set of nodes and edges), an algorithm developed to return an
answer after learning the function.
Given the question “How many stations are between city
Bengaluru and Pune ”, the correct answer should be “6”.

Objective of Literature Survey:
In depth analysis of graph algorithm to find shortest path
between points using an algorithm similar to
Dijkstra’s,Bellman-Ford, Floyd’s, and how Graph Network
with attention read and write can perform shortest path
calculations with minimal training and 100% accuracy.
